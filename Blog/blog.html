                    <u>Technology</u>,<br> The application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life
                    or,
                    as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.
                    It is the methodical process of organizing
                    and transforming matter, energy, and information to achieve specific, worthwhile goals.<br>
                    Technology is becoming more and more important in both our personal and professional life.
                    It is crucial to comprehend how people use technology and how technology affects how people
                    interact with one another and<br> the natural world. This is true for everyone who uses
                    technology in their personal and professional life, not just those who study, create, and apply
                    new technologies.

                    Technology is interested in the creative application of knowledge to planned
                    tasks involving humans and machines that achieve long-term objectives.
